# Simple Circuit is a python package that lets you solve a basic linear circuit with using defined buses, loads, resistors
# and a voltage source.  It works for simulating and solving DC circuits, and is useful for introductory circuit classes and
# labs, this one in particular uses a one resistor linear circuit with a set DC source and load, and is useful for modeling basic circuits.
